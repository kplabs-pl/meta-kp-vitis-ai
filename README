This repository contains patches for meta-vitis-ai layer and makes it compatible with nanbield Yocto release

Fixes include
* Missing `cstdint` includes
* Missing `std::` scopes
* `abseil` usage in CMake (really weird linking errors without fixing)
* Warnings reported by newer GCC (just silence warnings)
	* Most of these warnings come from Protobuf-generated code (/shrug)
* google log API change
